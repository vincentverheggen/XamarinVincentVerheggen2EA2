## <a name="description"></a>Challenge Description

If have been using the Xamarin Alliance Template App, you noticed that the app only contains a single page. This is ok to start with, but is a somewhat limiting experience, especially as we want to display more details about the items in the listview. Therefore, we will be extending the app with additional pages and a navigation mechanism. 
If you have been using your own app, you might have already unlocked this challenge; do read on, because maybe you'll learn something new or get some inspiration for a new feature.

The goal of this coding challenge is improve the user experience of our app by **adding multiple pages and implement navigation**. To unlock this challenge, you will need to:

1. **have multiple pages in your app,**
2. **add navigation to the different pages.**

We'll take a look at how you can add multiple pages to your Xamarin app and how to navigation between the different pages. As we have been using Xamarin.Forms for the template app, we'll explain these concepts using Xamarin.Forms, although you're free to implement a platform-specific UI too.

This is what the Xamarin Alliance template app could look like when navigation is implemented. In the screenshots below, you can see the main screen with the list of characters and the detail screen that shows the details of the selected character.

By the time we release the third challenge, we'll also publish the updated source code for the Xamarin Alliance template app.


## <a name="pagenavigation"></a>Page Navigation

With Xamarin.Forms there are a number of different ways to implement [page navigation](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/user-interface/navigation/). 

![Navigation experiences](https://github.com/msdxbelux/XamarinAlliance/blob/master/Challenge%202/images/xa_navigation.jpg)

For this challenge, we'll consider only two of them:
* Hierarchical navigation using the *NavigationPage* class
* Master-Detail pages using the *MasterDetailPage* class

For our Xamarin Alliance template app, we'll add a detail page that provides the details of a Star Wars character. This page will be called upon tapping the corresponding item in *ListView* on the main page.

> **TIP:** you could also add a carousel page to allowing scrolling through the list of characters.

### <a name="hierarchicalnavigation"></a>Hierarchical navigation

The *NavigationPage* class provides a hierarchival navigation experience where you can navigate through pages, both forwards and backwards. This class uses a stack (LIFO) of Page objects. To move to another page, you *push* a new page on the stack; when navigating backwards, you *pop* the current page from the stack and the new topmost page becomes the active page. It's recommended that the pages that are pushed on the navigation stack are *ContentPage* instances only.

The first page on the navigation stack is called the *root page* of the application. This is accomplished as follows (Page1Xaml is of type *ContentPage*):
```csharp
public App ()
{
  MainPage = new NavigationPage (new Page1Xaml ());
}
```

If we now want to navigate to another page from inside the Page1Xaml page (e.g. when tapping a button), we can leverage the *Navigation* property of the current page and invoke the *PushAsync* method on it, providing the target *ContentPage* instance:

```csharp
async void OnNextPageButtonClicked (object sender, EventArgs e)
{
  await Navigation.PushAsync (new Page2Xaml ());
}
```

To programmatically return to the previous page in the navigation stack, we again leverage the *Navigation* property on the current page, but this time, we invoke the *PopAsync* method:

```csharp
async void OnPreviousPageButtonClicked (object sender, EventArgs e)
{
  await Navigation.PopAsync ();
}
```

Note that you can push multiple pages onto the navigation stack before 'walking back the stack'. If you want to return straight to the root page of the stack, you can use the *Navigation.PopToRootAsync()' method.

In our Xamarin Alliance template app, we need to navigate to the character detail page when tapping on an entry in the list of characters on the main page. As shown above, we'll first create a root *NavigationPage* and push our main page on the stack. When an item is tapped, we push a character detail *ContentPage* on the stack.

```csharp
async void OnItemSelected(object sender, SelectedItemChangedEventArgs args)
{
    var item = args.SelectedItem as Item;
    if (item == null)
        return;

    await Navigation.PushAsync(new CharacterDetailPage(item));

    // Manually deselect item
    ItemsListView.SelectedItem = null;
}
```

As you notice from the code fragment above, we need to provide information about the selected item to the character detail page. One way to achieve this, is to pass the information to the constructor of the target page.

To navigate back from the character detail page to the main page, we would need to *pop* the page from the stack. However, if we use the default platform navigation controls (platform specific), no additional code is required in the detail page. If, on the other hand, we want to add an explicit control to navigate back, we'd have to invoke the *Navigation.PopAsync()* method.



More details about hierarchical navigation can be found [here](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/user-interface/navigation/hierarchical/).


### <a name="masterdetailnavigation"></a>Master-Detail pages

With the *MasterDetailPage* class you can represent a master-detail page relationship, where the master has a list of items and the item page shows the details about items in the master page. In addition to navigating to the detail page upon selecting an item in the master page, there is a navigation bar that allows navigating to the active item details. As for the hierarchical navigation, the detail page also contains the built-in navigation to return to the master page.

A *MasterDetailPage* contains 2 properties to represent the master and detail pages, which are both of type *Page*. It is recommended that the master page is of type *ContentPage*. You can create a *MasterDetailPage* using XAML or programmatically using C#:

```xml
<MasterDetailPage xmlns="http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms"
                  xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
                  xmlns:local="clr-namespace:MasterDetailPageNavigation;assembly=MasterDetailPageNavigation"
                  x:Class="MasterDetailPageNavigation.MainPage">
    <MasterDetailPage.Master>
        <local:MasterPage x:Name="masterPage" />
    </MasterDetailPage.Master>
    <MasterDetailPage.Detail>
        <NavigationPage>
            <x:Arguments>
                <local:CharacterDetailsPage />
            </x:Arguments>
        </NavigationPage>
    </MasterDetailPage.Detail>
</MasterDetailPage>  
```

The corresponding C# code would be as follows:
```csharp
public class MainPageCS : MasterDetailPage
{
    MasterPageCS masterPage;

    public MainPageCS ()
    {
        masterPage = new MasterPageCS ();
        Master = masterPage;
        Detail = new NavigationPage (new ContactsPageCS ());
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

With the above code fragments we still need to create the actual master and detail pages - these can both be *ContentPage* instances.

> **Note:** when creating the master page, it is required that the *Title* property is set, or an exception will occur.

```xml
<ContentPage xmlns="http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
             x:Class="MasterDetailPageNavigation.MasterPage"
             Padding="0,40,0,0"
             Icon="xamarinalliance.png"
             Title="Star Wars Characters">
```

Similar to the hierarchical navigation, the detail page contains the details of the selected item - it can be represented as a *ContentPage*.

To navigate from the master page to the detail page, we implement the *ItemSelected* event handler in the main page, which is of type *MasterDetailPage*. The main page gets access to the listview in the master page through a public property on the master page. The selected item is then passed as a constructor parameter to the detail page.

```csharp
public partial class MainPage : MasterDetailPage
{
    public MainPage ()
    {
        ...
        masterPage.ListView.ItemSelected += OnItemSelected;
    }

    void OnItemSelected (object sender, SelectedItemChangedEventArgs e)
    {
        var item = e.SelectedItem as MasterPageItem;
        if (item != null) {
            Detail = new NavigationPage ((Page)Activator.CreateInstance (item.TargetType));
            masterPage.ListView.SelectedItem = null;
            IsPresented = false;
        }
    }
}
```
